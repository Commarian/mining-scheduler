# Mining Scheduler

Mining Scheduler is a workforce coordination and task-management application designed for mining operations. It provides structured scheduling, personnel management, and issue tracking to support day-to-day operational planning across teams and shifts.

## Overview

The application enables authenticated users to:
- Log in with secure access control
- Manage personnel, roles, and assignments
- Create, update, open, and close operational issues or work tasks
- Track progress across teams and maintain organizational visibility
- Centralize scheduling and resource data that would otherwise be scattered across manual systems

The system was built to replace legacy spreadsheet-based planning processes and improve operational consistency and transparency.

## Features

- Python-based backend and interface
- User authentication and role-based access
- Personnel management and task scheduling
- Issue lifecycle management (open → active → closed)
- Dashboard-style summary of current workload and issues
- Historical traceability of task changes

## Technology Stack

- **Dependencies:** (Add libraries/frameworks here, e.g. Flask/FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
- **Database:** (Specify SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL or other)
- **Frontend/UI:** (CLI / Tkinter / Web UI if applicable)
